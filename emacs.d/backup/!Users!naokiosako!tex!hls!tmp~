A great number of papers have applied the enormous success
of the application of the fast Fourier transform for vibration
signal analysis in order to diagnose some many faults in the
rotating machinery [1], [7].
MCSA-FFT is a conventional spectral analysis method is
widely used in the diagnosis of electrical machines [11].
However, the use of FFT has several limitations such as the
no-stationary regime.
 Despite this limitation, researchers have confusion on the
absence of the frequency components at no-load running in
healthy state, and the existence of some characteristic
harmonics in faulty state of the motor.
 Our study will carefully explain this problem with logical
arguments. The experimental results help us to manipulate in
detail this fault. In addition, our study will analyze the
influence of the severity of the failure of the BRBs on the
shape of the current and its spectral content (frequency and
amplitude).
 The MCSA diagnosis method is applied in order to detect
the broken rotor bar faults [12]. An implementation of a test
bench which based on the stator current measure helps us to
obtain an important database. We will try to do a very detailed
check about the additional harmonics in case of the BRB
faults.

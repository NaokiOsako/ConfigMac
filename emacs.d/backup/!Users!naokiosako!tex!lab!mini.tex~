\textbf{ABSTRACT\\}
Recently, research has picked up a fervent pace in the area of fault diagnosis of electrical machines. The manufacturers and users of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic fea- tures in the software to improve salability and reliability. Apart from locating specific harmonic components in the line current (popularly known as motor current signature analysis), other sig- nals, such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different tech- niques, such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. In addition, human involvement in the actual fault detection decision making is slowly being replaced by automated tools, such as ex- pert systems, neural networks, fuzzy-logic-based systems; to name a few. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper de- scribing different types of faults and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics’ schemes will not be entirely out of place. In particular, such a review helps to avoid repetition of past work and gives a bird’s eye view to a new researcher in this area.\\

\textbf{ABSTRACT\\}
Induction motor plays a key role in ensuring
functional execution and smooth progression of modern
industries. But due to several harsh operational environments,
different types of faults, in the form of stator winding fault, rotor
fault etc. develop in the motor. If these faults, which are mostly
minor in nature initially, don’t get detected in earlier stages then
they may inflict major damage in the motor and consequently
may disrupt the plant’s production capacity. So far, several
studies primarily focusing on signature, model and expert system
based techniques have been performed for conditioning
monitoring of induction motors. Among all these techniques
MCSA (Motor Current Signature Analysis) technique has been
identified to be the most effective tool for diagnosis of induction
motor faults. Most of the traditional condition and monitoring
methods, using MCSA, that have been used till date are offline.
Such offline analysis leads to delayed fault detection, resulting in
plant production being eventually hampered, thus indirectly
increasing the production cost. That is why, modern day
industries demand online fault diagnosis methods which would
analyze faults in real time and prevent any unforeseen
production mishaps. FPGA or DSP where the signal is processed
in hardware unit can be used for online analysis. This paper
deals with 3-phase induction motor stator current acquisition
using LABVIEW, FPGA embedded with NI cRIO-9075 real time
controller and NI-9227 analog current input module looking
towards online fault diagnosis. \\

\textbf{ABSTRACT\\}
This paper presents the detailed detection of broken rotor bar faults in asynchronous motors (induction motors) using motor current signature analysis (MCSA). Recently, induction motors have become very popular in our daily lives because of their robust, adjustable speed drive, etc. Early detection of faults brings at least catastrophic damage in economic or security field. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is successfully used to detect many faults such as: the broken rotor bars. The FFT is based on the analysis of many signals in induction motor such as: current, power, vibration signal, electromagnetic torque, etc. In this work, MCSA-FFT applied to diagnose the induction motor under broken rotor bar faults. The frequency-domain in the rotating machinery sector has a very important part according to the slip value in order to localize the different components harmonics. Our study based on the FFT tool which is integrated in MCSA technique in the presence of the broken rotor bar faults. Our study presents new explanations concerning the spectral content of the stator current. In addition, we have confirmed the proposals ideas in this subject in order to detect the broken rotor bars. An experimental test for different conditions: at no load or at load operation, healthy or defective state of the induction motor has been performed.
